I am constantly changing things around so this will flow like the wind. Either that or I'll forget to upload to it. All that's here is what is needed to make the waybar config work, bc everything else isn't really stuff I'm either proud of or even comfortable causing other people to use.

I have no idea what the dependencies are-- I know that the media system needs playerctl, the wifi system needs rofi (the config comes with a drun, and it technically has a power system, but it's a terrible hack, so I don't recommend it), and the calendar needs galendae. Obviously it needs waybar as well, and you will probably need to tweak it if you aren't on hyprland.

Other than that, enjoy!
